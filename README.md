Thrifty is a personal finance management application with features that are beneficial for managing the finance of users.
The personal finance management app developed includes updating income, tracking expenses and sending alerts at the right time, etc. Each of these activities involves accessing information from different locations, collecting and consolidating monetary information. This app helps users to set their goals, keep track of their income and expenses by monthly basis.
Users can set reminders to get timely alerts. This app includes different modes of updating expenses either manually using the appâ€™s interface or by using OCR.
Graphical representation of income and expenses of the individual is another feature of this app which makes the user view the graph at a glance and can make a decision very quickly which is hardly possible through descriptive reports.
The app is designed and developed using JAVA, XML, and SQLite as the backend database.
